## Car Game

This is a Python based car game where you are a car and you have to dodge other cars in the lanes to build points and do so as the speed gets increasingly faster.

To start, open this up in VSCode, make sure to cd into the root directory "Car-Game", then type "python car_game.py" in your terminal.
